#MySQL Snippets (queries) Go Here

 - use a `.snip` extension (for now) for the actual snippet
 - store the code as plain text (for now)
 - annotate functions, usage, parameters, etc using comments appropriate for live usage
 - if aforementioned notations are too bulky to be included, please drop it in a `.txt` file of the same name
