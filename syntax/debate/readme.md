#What's Going On Here?
The purpose of this directory is to debate the usefulness of various notations,
formats, and languages used to store snippets. We can all save each other a
lot of time and energy in this universe if we can decide on best practices for
information sharing. This is why microformats are becoming more and more popular:
Because having a standard of communication is fundamentally essential to cooperation
in the digital realm.

Some things to consider:
 - Feel free to plead your case, call me an idiot, or whatever leads to a useful result!
 - We (ie "I") will undoubtedly have to rewrite some things once things coalesce in this git.
 - I am currently a student, so my time and knowledge may be limited here and there.
 - Please branch to suggest a new course of action (like a completely new/unmentioned format).
 - I am new to GitHub, so if this is set up all rubbish, let me know.
