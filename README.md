# damgood-snippets
Snippets for various webdev languages.

##content index
 - `/damgood-snippets/syntax/debate/` = discussion about the most useful format for storing snippets
 - `/damgood-snippets/<language>/` = snippets for the respective language.

 
##notes
 - Snippets will be in plain text for now. 
 - Any documantation or usage notes will need to be commented until I(/we) settle on a notation format.
 - Feel free to let me know if I'm doing everything completely the wrong way. We never stop learning, and I'm nrew to Git(Hub).
 - **Any** suggestions are welcome, this *is* meant to be a **resource** after all!
