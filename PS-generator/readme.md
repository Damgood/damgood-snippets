#Photoshop Generator Snippets Go Here

 - use a `.snip` extension (for now) for the actual snippet
 - store the code as plain text (for now)
 - annotate usage in a clearly delineated area below the snippet (this is different for this sub-folder, since Generator is drastically different from other languages for which we are compiling snippets)
 - if aforementioned notations are too bulky to be included, please drop it in a `.txt` file of the same name
