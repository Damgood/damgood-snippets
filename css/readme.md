#CSS Snippets Go Here

 - use a `.snippet` extension (for now) for the actual snippet
 - store the code as plain text (for now) or [JSON][1] (using the JSON [snippet snippet][2]).
 - annotate functions, usage, parameters, etc using comments appropriate for live usage
 - if aforementioned notations are too bulky to be included, please drop it in a `.txt` file of the same name
