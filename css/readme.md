#CSS Snippets Go Here

 - use a `.snippet` extension (for now) for the actual snippet
 - store the code as plain text (for now) or [JSON](http://www.jsoneditoronline.org/?id=1037a10b2f3897900fb72c947b6126b3) (using the [JSON snippet snippet](https://github.com/Damgood/damgood-snippets/blob/master/syntax/wrap_JSON.snippet) ).
 - add fields to annotate functions, usage, parameters, etc as necessary.
 - if aforementioned notations are too bulky to be included, please drop it in a `.txt` file of the same name
